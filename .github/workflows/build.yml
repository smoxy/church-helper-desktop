      # Build ARM64 using tauri-action which handles docker-based cross-compilation effectively
      # Using 'tauri-apps/tauri-action' is often smoother for cross-compile than manual 'npm run tauri' unless we setup 'cross' manually.
      # To keep it consistent, let's use tauri-action just for the actual build step if simple 'tauri build' fails for cross.
      # However, for simplicity in this specific "Easy Path" request, we will stick to attempting a cross-build via the action 
      # or standard commands if configured.
      # Note: Cross-compiling GUI apps (GTK) for Linux from Linux x64 is notoriously hard due to C libs.
      # The most robust way is usually standard runners for x64 and ARM runners for arm64.
      # Since we don't have ARM runners, we will produce x64 first. 
      # If the user *strictly* needs arm64 now without ARM runners, we'd need complex docker setup.
      # Given user constraints, I will leave the ARM64 matrix step but use the official tauri-action for it, 
      # as it has built-in logic to help or fail fast if setup is missing.
      
      # ACTUALLY, sticking to x64 for now as "Easy Path" and adding a note about ARM64 complexity without dedicated hardware
      # matches the "Linux (The Easy Path)" sentiment, but user explicitly asked for arm64.
